## Development vs Production

### Current Development Implementation
- In-memory storage for rapid prototyping
- Mock TikTok API responses for testing
- Local authentication without external OAuth
- Simplified campaign automation

### Production Requirements
- PostgreSQL database with connection pooling
- TikTok Business API credentials
- Redis for session storage and caching
- Background job queue (Bull/BullMQ)
- CDN for static assets
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Monitoring (Sentry, DataDog)
- Load balancing for scale

## API Keys Required for Production
1. **TikTok Business API**: OAuth client ID and secret
2. **Google Gemini API**: For AI-powered features
3. **Stripe API**: For payment processing (optional)
4. **SendGrid/Postmark**: For transactional emails
5. **Twilio**: For SMS notifications (optional)

## Security Considerations
- All API keys stored as environment variables
- JWT secrets rotated regularly
- Database credentials encrypted
- HTTPS enforced in production
- CORS properly configured
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection via Drizzle ORM
